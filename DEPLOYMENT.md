## 2. GitHub Setup Steps

1. Create your repository:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: "555"
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with any files

2. Clone and prepare the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sehajbirsingh/555.git
   cd 555
   ```

3. Copy all the files listed above into your local repository, maintaining the exact folder structure.

4. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

5. Create and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

6. Setup GitHub Pages:
   - Go to https://github.com/sehajbirsingh/555/settings/pages
   - Under "Build and deployment":
     - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
     - Branch: "main" / "/(root)"
   - Click "Save"

Your app will be available at: https://sehajbirsingh.github.io/555/

## 3. File Contents (Important Files and their Purposes)
Here are the current contents of each file that you need to copy:

1. breathing-circle.tsx: Located at client/src/components/breathing-circle.tsx  # Main animation component
2. breathing-controls.tsx: Located at client/src/components/breathing-controls.tsx # Play/pause and sound controls
3. use-breathing.ts: Located at client/src/lib/use-breathing.ts # Breathing cycle logic
4. use-sound.ts: Located at client/src/lib/use-sound.ts # Sound management
5. home.tsx: Located at client/src/pages/home.tsx # Main application page
6. Other files:  These are configuration files for proper building and styling (package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.ts, theme.json, index.html).


## Notes:
- Make sure to copy the exact file contents as they are in the current project
- The app requires no backend when deployed to GitHub Pages
- All the animations and sound effects will work directly in the browser
